Sports application for SimpleBet.io Interview challenge

You should be able to build as a regular flutter project.

I had issues compiling on ios, android and web (screenshot in assets folder) for the player details screen so i wasnt able to run the code
I tried all the debugging steps online but i wasnt able to get it to run. I didnt want to try and reinstall because
atleast my IDE was able to still register that flutter is installed so it was able to suggest widgets and what not
Didnt want to be in a situation where i lost even that.
Flutter wasnt working for some reason but i tried to implement as much as i could.

Id be happy to walk you through my approach and technical questions.
